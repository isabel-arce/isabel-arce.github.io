# Borough Analysis
Demographic-wise, Pelham is broken into two sections. These two sections can be observed through the primary postal codes, 10461 and 10462. The 10461 area has a majority White population. The Hispanic population varies between 11% and 30% but nothing compared to the White population. Within this zip code, the Asian population is low with the population almost never exceeding 20%. However, once you reach 10462 the white population doesnâ€™t breach past 40%, but the Hispanic population is almost always over 50%. The Black population is still in the single digits but sometimes reaches 11% but no more.
