# Borough Analysis
Demographic-wise, Pelham is broken into two sections. These two sections can be observed through the primary postal codes, 10461 and 10462. The 10461 area has a majority White population. The Hispanic population varies between 11% and 30% but nothing compared to the White population. Within this zip code, the Asian population is low with the population almost never exceeding 20%. However, once you reach 10462 the white population doesn’t breach past 40%, but the Hispanic population is almost always over 50%. The Black population is still in the single digits but sometimes reaches 11% but no more.

## Introducing the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan
The Greener, Greater Buildings Plan is a plan made specifically for New York City and its energy-consuming skyscrapers. The Greener, Greater, Buildings Plan is only one part of PlaNYC, a set of goals related to improving the quality of air, water, and overall standard of living. The main goal of PlaNYC is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and since most of the emissions come from buildings, the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan was made. Although there are almost a million buildings in New York City, the main problem comes from the large-scale buildings so the policies of this plan are meant to address those specifically. 

The first thing the Greener, Greater Buildings plan is establishing is an “energy code” which must be met by building owners if their renovations impact the energy system. Secondly, data of the energy usage of each building will be recorded for the public so residents aren’t left in the dark regarding the quality of their water and energy. The third is a mandatory check on all energy systems to make sure they are on par with regulations. Then there are two “supplementary components” to help the building owners have the resources to abide by the plan. This, in my opinion, is one of the most important parts of the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan because it gives building owners a shoulder to lean on. This plan asks a lot of dedication from people so having well-equipped professionals is essential in things progressing smoothly. The plan also gives wiggle room for building owners going through financial hardships and therefore cannot comply with the many requirements. 

One of the main aspects of the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan is its transparency when it comes to users' energy consumption. However, in addition to this transparency, the city is also saving almost a quarter billion dollars.
